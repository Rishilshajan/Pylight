## 📂 Explore the Files
This repository is structured to provide clear, practical examples of core Python concepts. Here's a quick guide to what you'll find:

* **`app.py`**: This is the **main file** containing the bulk of the Python code examples and tutorials. It's your primary starting point for exploring fundamental concepts.
* **`student.py`**: A Python file demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, specifically focusing on creating and managing `Student` objects using classes.
* **`Question.py`**: Another example of OOP, this file defines a `Question` class, likely used to illustrate how to create and handle quiz-like questions programmatically.
* **`employ.txt` & `employ1.txt`**: These are simple text files used to demonstrate **Python's file I/O operations**. You'll see examples of how Python can read from and write to external files.
* **`index.html`**: This file is included to show how Python can interact with and process other file types, specifically in the context of **reading and writing web-related content**.
* **`useful_tool.py`**: This file serves as an example of a **custom Python module**. It demonstrates how you can create your own modules and then import and use functions or classes defined within them in other Python scripts.
* **`Chef.py`**: This file introduces the concept of **inheritance in OOP**. It defines a base `Chef` class.
* **`ChineseeChef.py`**: This file builds on `Chef.py`, showcasing how **inheritance** works by creating a `ChineseChef` class that inherits properties and methods from the `Chef` class, while also adding its own unique functionalities.
